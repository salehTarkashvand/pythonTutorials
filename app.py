course = "python programming"  #string

# The code `print(course[0:18])` is slicing the string variable `course` from index 0 up to (but not
# including) index 18 and then printing the sliced portion of the string.
print(course[0:18])

# `print(course[0:])` is slicing the string variable `course` starting from index 0 up to the end of
# the string, and then printing the sliced portion. Since only the start index is specified and no end
# index is provided, it will slice the string from index 0 to the end of the string and print it.
print(course[0:])

# `print(course[:])` is slicing the entire string stored in the variable `course` and then printing
# the sliced portion. In this case, since no start or end index is specified, it will slice the entire
# string and print it.
print(course[:])

# `print(course[:-1])` is slicing the string variable `course` from the beginning up to (but not
# including) the last character, and then printing the sliced portion of the string. This means it
# will print the entire string except for the last character.
print(course[:-1])

# `print(course[::2])` is slicing the string variable `course` with a #step# size of 2. This means it
# will start from the beginning of the string and select every second character, then print the
# resulting sliced portion.
print(course[::2])
