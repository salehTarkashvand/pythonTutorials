# for

# The `for` loop in Python is iterating over a range of numbers from 0 to 3 (exclusive) using the
# `range(4)` function. Inside the loop, it is printing the message "message" and then printing the
# current number in the iteration. This loop will execute 4 times, with `number` taking on the values
# 0, 1, 2, and 3 in each iteration.


# in

# The `in` keyword in this context is used to iterate over the elements of the iterable
# object `range(4)`. It assigns each element of the iterable to the variable `number` in
# each iteration of the loop.

for number in range(4):
    print("message")
    print(number)
