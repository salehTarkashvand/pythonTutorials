course = 10  # number operators

# `course + 3` is adding the value of `course` (which is 10) to 3. So, the result will be 13.
print(course + 3)

# `course - 3` is subtracting the value of 3 from the value of `course`, which is 10 in this
# case. So, the result will be 7.
print(course - 3)

# `course * 3` is multiplying the value of `course` (which is 10) by 3. So, the result will be
# 30.
print(course * 3)

# `course / 3` is performing division operation. It is dividing the value of `course`, which is
# 10 in this case, by 3. So, the result will be the quotient of 10 divided by 3, which is
# approximately 3.3333333333333335 in Python since it performs floating-point division by
# default.
print(course / 3)

# `course // 3` is performing integer division. It divides the value of `course`, which is 10 in
# this case, by 3 and returns the integer part of the result.
print(course // 3)

# The expression `course % 3` is using the modulo operator in Python. It calculates the
# remainder when `course` (which is 10) is divided by 3.
print(course % 3)
# The expression `course ** 3` is raising the value of the variable `course` to the power of 3.
# In this case, since `course` is 10, `course ** 3` calculates 10 raised to the power of 3,
# which is equal to 1000.
print(course**3)

# The expression `course += 3` is a shorthand notation for incrementing the value of the variable
# `course` by 3. It is equivalent to writing `course = course + 3`.
course += 3

# `course -= 3` is a shorthand notation for decrementing the value of the variable `course` by 3. It
# is equivalent to writing `course = course - 3`.
course -= 3

# `course *= 3` is shorthand notation for multiplying the value of the variable `course` by 3 and
# assigning the result back to `course`. It is equivalent to writing `course = course * 3`. So, in
# this case, it is multiplying the current value of `course` by 3 and updating the value of `course`
# to the result of that multiplication.
course *= 3

# The expression `course **= 3` is shorthand notation for raising the value of the variable `course`
# to the power of 3 and assigning the result back to `course`. It is equivalent to writing `course =
# course ** 3`.
course **= 3
