# ternary operator 

age = 15

# This line of code is using a ternary operator in Python. It is checking if the variable `age` is
# greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it assigns the value "eligible" to the
# variable `message`. If the condition is false, it assigns the value "not eligible" to the variable
# `message`. This is a concise way of writing an if-else statement in a single line.

message = "eligible" if age >= 18 else "not eligible"

print(message)
