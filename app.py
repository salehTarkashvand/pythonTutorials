# comparison operators

# ------------------------- comparison operators for number

# The expression `3 == 3` is using the equality operator `==` to compare if the value on the
# left side (3) is equal to the value on the right side (3). In this case, it will return `True`
# because 3 is indeed equal to 3.
print(3 == 3)

# `3 != 3` is using the inequality operator `!=` to compare if the value on the left side (3) is
# not equal to the value on the right side (3). In this case, it will return `False` because 3
# is equal to 3.
print(3 != 3)

# `3 >= 3` is using the greater than or equal to operator `>=` to compare if the value on the
# left side (3) is greater than or equal to the value on the right side (3). In this case, it
# will return `True` because 3 is equal to 3, satisfying the condition of being greater than or
# equal to 3.
print(3 >= 3)

# `3 <= 3` is using the less than or equal to operator `<=` to compare if the value on the left
# side (3) is less than or equal to the value on the right side (3). In this case, it will
# return `True` because 3 is equal to 3, satisfying the condition of being less than or equal to
# 3.
print(3 <= 3)

# `3 < 3` is using the less than operator `<` to compare if the value on the left side (3) is
# less than the value on the right side (3). In this case, it will return `False` because 3 is
# not less than 3; they are equal.
print(3 < 3)

# `3 > 3` is using the greater than operator `>` to compare if the value on the left side (3) is
# greater than the value on the right side (3). In this case, it will return `False` because 3
# is not greater than 3; they are equal.
print(3 > 3)


# ------------------------- comparison operators for string

# The `ord("a")` function in Python returns the Unicode code point of the character "a". In this
# case, it will return the integer value 97, which is the Unicode code point for the lowercase
# letter "a".
print(ord("a"))

# The expression `"saleh" > "hamed"` is comparing the two strings "saleh" and "hamed" using the
# greater than operator `>
print("saleh" > "hamed")

# The expression `"saleh" == "SALEH"` is using the equality operator `==` to compare if the
# string "saleh" is equal to the string "SALEH". In this case, it will return `False` because
# the comparison is case-sensitive in Python, and "saleh" is not equal to "SALEH" due to the
# difference in letter case.
print("saleh" == "SALEH")
