# `import math` is a Python statement that imports the math module. This module provides mathematical
# functions and constants for various mathematical operations. By importing the math module, you gain
# access to functions like trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, constants like pi, and more
# advanced mathematical operations.
import math

course = 10  # number methods

# The `round(2.7)` function is rounding the number 2.7 to the nearest integer. In this case, it will
# return 3.
round(2.7)

# The `abs(-2)` function is returning the absolute value of the number -2. In this case, it will
# return 2, as the absolute value of -2 is 2.
abs(-2)

# The `math.ceil(2.7)` function is returning the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2.7. In
# this case, it will return 3 because 3 is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to 2.7.
math.ceil(2.7)
